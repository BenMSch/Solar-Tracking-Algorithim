# Solar-Tracking-Algorithim
This is a dual-axis solar tracking algorithm to generate the most amount of net energy from a solar panel. This was written by a high school student.  Places for code optimization exist when looping through combinations of angles to make the compiling time faster. However, the compiling times should take less than 20 seconds without those optimizations. The location of the sun is from pvlib. You will need to install the package, pvlib. To do this, you can use either pip or an anaconda. This code was used for a high school science fair, and because of this, some unnecessary graphs are outputted. Furthermore, some sections of the code are crossed out because they are unnecessary for the algorithm. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, you can put them in the issues tab. All of the files of code are header files. The naming scheme was used for development and doesnâ€™t represent the final purpose of the functions and classes. To run the algorithm properly, you want to have all the header files and run the listing header file, not the one called main.
