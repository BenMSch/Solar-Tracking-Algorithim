# Solar-Tracking-Algorithim
Dual axis solar tracking algorithm, to generate the most amount of net energy from a solar panel.
Written by a High-Schooler, places for optimization of the code to make the compiling time faster, however, should take less than 20 seconds without those optimizations.
The location of the sun is from pvlib. You will need to install that package you can use pip or annaconda.
This code was used for a science fair, because of this there are some unnecarsry graphs that are outputted, furthermore, their are some sections of the code that are corrsed out because they are not neccesary for the algorithim.
This code isn't perfect, however, it gets the job done. 
If you have any questions, comments or conecerns you can put them in the issues tab.
All of the other files in this are header files, the naming scheme is not amazing. 
To run the algorithim propperly you are going to want to have all the header files and run listing not main. This is confusing and i understand however, the development of this started in october, during this time alot of changes have been made and it was easeir to keep the naming scheme how it origannly was.
