# Solar-Tracking-Algorithim
Dual axis solar tracking algorithm, to generate the most amount of net energy from a solar panel.
Written by a High-Schooler, places for optimization of the code to make the compiling time faster, however, should take less than 20 seconds without those optimizations.
The location of the sun is from pvlib. You will need to install that package you can use pip or annaconda.
This code was used for a science fair, because of this there are some unnecarsry graphs that are outputted, furthermore, their are some sections of the code that are corrsed out because they are not neccesary for the algorithim.
This code isn't perfect, however, it gets the job done. 
If you have any questions, comments or conecerns you can put them in the issues tab.
